Overview

The Basketball Action Recognition tool leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to identify and classify basketball actions in real-time from video footage. By identifying key actions such as shooting, passing, and dribbling, this tool aims to provide actionable insights and improve game analysis.

Project Objectives

Real-Time Action Detection: Accurately detect and classify basketball actions in real-time or near-real-time.
User-Friendly Interface: Provide an intuitive web-based interface for uploading videos and viewing action classifications.
Scalability and Performance: Ensure the model performs efficiently on varying video qualities and scales for large datasets.
Technology Stack

Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:
Computer Vision: OpenCV
Deep Learning: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
Data Manipulation: NumPy
Web Framework: Flask or Django
Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction, with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing temporal sequences.
Dataset: Custom-labeled basketball clips or publicly available sports datasets, like Kinetics-700.
Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/basketball-action-recognition.git
cd basketball-action-recognition
Install Required Libraries: Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Environment Variables (if needed):
Configure any API keys or other settings in a .env file.
Dataset and Preprocessing

The project uses a subset of the Kinetics-700 dataset or custom-labeled basketball footage. Key preprocessing steps include:

Frame Extraction: Extract video frames using OpenCV.
Resizing and Normalization: Resize frames to a standard size and normalize pixel values.
Data Annotation: Label video clips for basketball actions like "shooting," "passing," "dribbling," etc., using tools such as LabelImg if custom annotations are needed.
Model Development

The action recognition model has two main components:

Feature Extraction: A CNN model processes each frame to extract spatial features.
Temporal Modeling: An RNN or LSTM layer captures temporal sequences of actions.
The model is trained on labeled data and optimized for accuracy in real-time action detection.

Usage

To run the tool locally:

Start the Web Interface:
python app.py
Upload and Analyze Videos:
Access the interface at http://localhost:5000 (or the appropriate port).
Upload a video to see real-time action classifications.
Results

The model was trained on [specific datasets], achieving an accuracy of XX% in detecting key basketball actions.
Sample output classifications for actions like shooting, passing, and dribbling are shown below:
